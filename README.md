## biglike

An isometric shooter roguelike based on the characters of Big Incorporated


### Style
Art will be somewhat after postal 1, using 3d models for characters, and hand drawn art for backgrounds. The hand drawn art will be turned into tilesets, 
which will then be used for the generated levels. None of this is done yet because all of our artists are bazoingas adhd and also art is hard.

### Whats done so far
Useable base AI patterns are done, and are somewhat fun to fight against (and also support infighting). One enemy is added, a shotgunner. 2 hitscan weapons are added with models and animations: a golden eagle and a sawed off shotgun. Movement for one player character is pretty good (don't want to say anything's finished at this point). 

### What to do (code/game engine stuff) (short term)
- [X] level collision generation stuff, proper layering
- [X] finish basic ai patterns
- [X] add in some weapons and work on attacks and killing things
- [X] finish movement for starting character 
- [ ] add in a few unique enemies and their patterns
- [ ] add in ammo system, weapon and item pickups
- [ ] implement sounds, (gunshots, hitsounds and other stuff)
- [ ] add in particles (gibs and stuff)
- [ ] level generation!!! (extensible method for easy later development wooo!!)

### What to do (other stuff)
- [X] Create a short term use tileset to use for testing
- [ ] Create models for a player character and some enemies
- [ ] create a few tilesets to be used for a demo
- [ ] create appealing sounds and find or make a few tracks 
- [ ] design test level to really see how fun stuff is so far, tweak until pretty good
- [ ] grind out tilesets and models (damn)

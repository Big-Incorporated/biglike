## biglike

An isometric roguelike (booooo) but zany enough (in the future) to be considered original. 


### Style
Art will be somewhat after postal 1, using 3d models for characters, and hand drawn art for backgrounds. The hand drawn art will be turned into tilesets, 
which will then be used for the generated levels. None of this is done yet because all of our artists are bazoingas adhd.

### Whats done so far
Basically nothing. There is a little bit of ai code i wrote, basic movement and level collision generation, but nothing else besides that.

### What to do (code stuff) (also short term so i dont get overwhelmed)
- [X] level collision generation stuff, proper layering
- [X] finish basic ai patterns
- [X] add in some weapons and work on attacks and killing things
- [ ] add in a few unique enemies and their patterns
- [ ] finish movement for starting character 

### What to do (visual art)
- [X] Create a short term use tileset to use for testing
- [ ] Create models for a player character and some enemies
- [ ] create a final tileset for use with a test level (and later a final level)
- [ ] design test level to really see how fun stuff is so far, tweak until pretty good
- [ ] grind out tilesets and models (damn)
